### Completed Critiera
- Basic React UI with event handling and display
- Basic Memory Functions
- Testing for Reducers and Actions

### Incompleted Criteria
- Basic calculator functionality (+, -, /, *, =)
- React UI Testing

### Future Plans
- Implement a queue data type for recording user inputs
- Consider implementing [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) [(npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reverse-polish-notation) to handle order of operations and avoid using js eval.
- Improve styling
- Use Enzyme to "mount" UI components for testing

### Notes
I used Corey House's [React-Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) bootstrap for the react/redux boilerplate.
